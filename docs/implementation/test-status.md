# Test Status

## Runnable In This Workspace

- JSON parse validation for all `.json` files.
- `npm run validate` inside `shared/typescript`, covering:
  - `singlePhoneOnly` invariant
  - identity recognition disabled
  - telephoto lens recommendation from fixture device capabilities
  - normalized Target Match
  - safety-qualified movement guidance
- `LensPilotVisionTests` on macOS CI, covering the `SceneDebugState` to native `SceneState` bridge.
- `LensPilotCoreTests` on macOS CI, covering burst capture review ranking and empty-burst handling.

## Not Runnable Here

- `swift test` for the iOS Swift package, because the Swift toolchain and Xcode are not installed in this Windows workspace.

## Test Command

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\test-all.ps1
```

On macOS with Xcode/Swift installed, the same script will also run:

```bash
swift test
```

from `ios/Package`.
